\subsection{Debugging Caesar Programs}
You can debug Caesar programs using the normal Java debugger. To set a breakpoint, right-click in the gutter of the editor and choose "Toggle Breakpoint", or simply double-click in the gutter.\\\\

With one or more breakpoints set, you launch the Eclipse debugger in the normal way by clicking on the debug icon in the toolbar.\\\\

You can use the Java Debug step filters (Window -$>$ Preferences -$>$ Java -$>$ Debug -$>$ Step Filtering) to make this process a little easier.
Note: A current limitation is that you cannot step into advices.
