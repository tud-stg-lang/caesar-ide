\section{Introduction}
This documentation describes how to use the \caesarj -Eclipse Plugin.


\subsection{What is \caesarj{}?}
\caesar ~is a new aspect-oriented programming language, which addresses the most important goals of the software design: modularity, reuse, flexibility and correctness. It is easy to learn because it fully integrates with the Java programming language. All new language extensions are compiled to efficient Java byte-code.\\\\
The \caesar ~highlights are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Virtual Classes
	\item Mixin Composition
	\item Collaboration Interfaces	
	\item Bindings
	\item Aspectual Polymorphism	
	\item Dynamic Deployment		
\end{itemize}
