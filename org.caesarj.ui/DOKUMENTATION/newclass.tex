\subsection{Adding a Class to Your Project}
First, create a package for your class files. Select the project you created in the package explorer, right click, and select
"New" -$>$ "Package" -$>$ "Other" from the context menu. You have to look for "Package" in the "Java" folder.\\\\

	\label{fig:package}
\end{figure}\\\\
Name the package "myPackage" then click finish.\\\\
Select the package you just created, and from the context menu select "New" -$>$ "Class". Name the
class "HelloWorld" and select the option to let Eclipse create a new main method for you. Click "Finish".\newpage
Edit the text in the editor so that it looks something like this:\\\\

\end{center}
	
Save the file.\\\\

Notice that unlike in a Java project, there was no eager parsing of the buffer as you typed (the outline view didn't update). Your Eclipse workbench should be looking something like this:\\
