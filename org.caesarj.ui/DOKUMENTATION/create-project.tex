From the File menu select new... . If "Caesar Project" appears
in the list, select it.\\\\
If it doesn't, this is probably the first time you've used the plugin - select "Other" and then "Caesar" and "Caesar Project".

The new project wizard appears:

\end{figure}

This wizard has identical behaviour to the new Java project wizard (except of course that
it creates a project with the Caesar nature).\\
When you click "Finish" on the new project wizard, your project will be created.\\\\
Now you propperly want to open the "Caesar Perspective". Select Window -$>$ Open Perspective -$>$ Others -$>$ CaesarJDT Perspective.
If this is the first time you've used CJDTP, you will see the following dialog pop-up:\\

\end{figure}


This dialog configures some Eclipse settings that will make your life much easier when
working with CaesarJ projects. Leave everything selected and click
"Finish".
